Oh, misty eye of the Mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the Mountain side hey

And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on the Mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
